## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I get rid of your horrible icons in the gutter ?

> It'll be done automatically next time you'll save your sheet :wink:

### Can I add another or my own CDN ?

> Of course you can, unless this project wouldn't be Open Source !  
> You basically just have to tweak [CDNContent.py](CDNContent.py) and imitate what is done there for your provider.  
> Don't forget to share your work with the world ! :earth_africa:  
> Or... you can just open an [issue here](https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/CDNUpdates/issues/new) and I'll do my best to handle your case !
